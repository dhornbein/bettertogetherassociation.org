With no coworkers to meet with at the watercooler in between tasks, freelancing can be pretty lonely! But it doesn’t have to be — come find collaborators and peers, connect with other people in your field, and maybe find your next gig.

Our April 23 event will provide an opportunity for freelancers to meet up for the purpose of sharing skills and learning new things to help them take their businesses to the next level. Before attending, briefly take a moment to consider what skills you can offer to the group, while also taking stock of the help you need to grow.

During the event, we’ll break out into interactive groups based on skills we can share and skills we need to learn. Don’t feel like you need to stay in one group during the entirety of the event — you can bounce around to different groups as you problem solve your way to a better freelance business!

As an added bonus, we’ll have delicious food provided by Name.com. Come hungry for food and knowledge!
