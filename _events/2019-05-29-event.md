Whether you're a current or aspiring freelancer, or someone who hires (or might want to hire) freelancers, this is the event for you!

In addition to tasty free food, join Better Together members and a panel of both freelancers and those who hire them, discussing what works best. Learn great tips to ensure that all your freelancer-client relationships are as productive and problem-free as possible.

If you’re looking to hire or be hired, this is the event for you. Bring your business cards and questions and be prepared for some good old-fashioned networking too—maybe you’ll find the freelancer or client you’ve been looking for!
