Want to help create a Freelance Association in Colorado? Have ideas to make this Meetup group even better? What to help shape Freelance Business Week (this Sept 30 - Oct 4 see fbwden.com)

This will be a workshop where we will learn about Better Together and work on different initiatives of this group. Expect to get in groups, work on things your interested in, and help build Better Together!

I'll try and get food provided!

Location TBD and Time is subject to change, please keep an eye on this event.
