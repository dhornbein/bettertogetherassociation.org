So, what do you do? It's a question we are asked all 👏 the 👏 time 👏 and how you answer could mean the difference between landing your next gig or a missed opportunity.

Join Better Together to workshop an effective, short, and sweet answer to this question (commonly called an elevator pitch). This event is for anyone who dreads talking about themselves.

It is also an event for those of you who are great at talking about yourself, because we'll be helping each other develop our pitches through an interactive workshop.

Come hungry, food will be provided and there will be time to try out your new pitch with some good old fashion networking on the tail end.
