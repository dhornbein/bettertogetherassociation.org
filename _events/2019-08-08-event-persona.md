A persona is a representation of a user or buyer of your ideal target audience. Learn how personas are used both in product design and marketing campaigns and why they're so important for the success of both.

We will provide strategies to create buyer personas that describe your core buyer as holistic individuals and illuminate how you can strategically market to them.

Come prepared to put new and old skills to practice! We encourage participants to collaborate and co-create, teach and learn. There is no prior experience with generating personas or user research required.
