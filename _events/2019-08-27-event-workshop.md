Want to help create a Freelance Association in Colorado? We will be coming together to work on the Better Together Association by aligning the business plan, branding, and user research work that has been going on.

Better Together is the organization behind this meetup group and the upcoming Freelance Business Week (fbwden.com). The association aims to officially launch October 4th. This is the perfect event if you want to be part of building a new kind of organization for independent workers built by independent workers.
