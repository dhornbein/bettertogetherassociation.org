        You are an expert and a resource to our community of independent workers. We invite you to share your expertise by
        participating in <strong>Better Together’s</strong> regularly scheduled program for the enrichment of our members. Our purpose is to
        <strong>improve the quality of life for independent workers by providing accessible, enriching, and engaging events</strong>–both virtual
        and in-person.

        We are looking for hosts to develop regular scheduled workshops and events at least once a month starting with a 3-month
        commitment. The topic, format, and frequency are up to you.
